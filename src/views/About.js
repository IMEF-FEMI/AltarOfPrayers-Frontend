                I'm Dustin Atwood, a Software Engineer with a passion for
                programming I love to learn and discover all things Ruby,
                Javascript, HTML and CSS. I found coding a great way to express
                myself. With technology always moving forward and continually
                changing, I am always learning about the new trends and staying
                up to date in the lastest releases. When I'm not writing code, I
                enjoy cooking attending concerts traveling and spending time
                with my daughter in the great outdoors üèî
